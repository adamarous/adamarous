### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting by the next few week of tests at school
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++, data structures and algorithms
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on whatever might give this poor lad a chance at suffocating from coding and not only maths
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with pointers
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about whatever a science-oriented HS senior might know about
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: hack me!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I don't know whether I'll be proud of not having changed this description once I actually become a software engineer, or if I'll like the fact that I did something other than pure productive coding
